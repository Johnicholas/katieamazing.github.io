So I made a little game in Python! I have gone through the Coursera course offered by Rice University called "Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" at least twice now, so this time through I was pretty bored. Instead of dutifully completing the "Pong" assignment, I decided to make Breakout instead.

I discovered a useful hack for motivation along the way, which is something that I have struggled with since my move to NYC. I made art! And interspersing making art with the more cerebral project of coding made me feel less frustrated. And having pretty assets that I was excited to use and see working really got me working to finish this project.

This was also a first try at getting my game a little "juicy," as discussed in this outstanding talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) and in [this repo](https://github.com/grapefrukt/juicy-breakout) on GitHub. This also added to the fun, and though I have a lot more ideas for cute thematic juices for this, I think it's time to wrap it up. I have liked the training wheels of CodeSkulptor, but I'm concerned I've become a little dependent. I am going to try and make some interactive stuff with other engines and languages for awhile, lest I go full Pythonic!

Anyway, here's a gameplay gif which I apologize for the size of:
