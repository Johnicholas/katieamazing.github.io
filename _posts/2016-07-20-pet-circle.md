I made this little snippet as a "My First Program Without Training Wheels" in CodeSkuptor more than a year ago, but I've updated and added to it a bit recently, so I thought I'd share it here.

The buttons, which change size and hue of the circle and update variables that determine the display text, are old. I've added a particle system based on the same one used in my Bubble Bricks game, also in Python/CodeSkuptor. I updated this to apply for something, so this is my best shot at clean, readable, commented code. I am hoping I can look back on this in a few months or years and reflect on my growth!
