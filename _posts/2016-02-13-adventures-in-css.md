Working on getting my website closer to something I'm proud of. Earlier this month, I spent some time rummaging frantically through Jekyll, Liquify, and Shopify documentation trying to figure out a way to break my posts up by month. The way Shopify handles dates made this sort of a pain, though after I'd gotten it going in a messy, hacked-together way, I read through some stack overflow posts about people doing what I'm doing in a more elegant manner (iterating over months as variables, instead of my current hard-coded solution). 

I did a little CSS today trying to package each month into a neat little box. I'm sure I'm not doing good design, but it was fun to use CSS. I remember it vaguely from using Dreamweaver back when Dreamweaver was a Macromedia product when I was in high school!

I'm looking forward to introducing a custom variable for what I am reading this month. Being able to express right in my Markdown posts what I am reading and having that populate to my index.html would be neato, and it will be good practice to get a custom variable going. I'd also like to try adding code to iterate over the months and auto-populate some of the new fields I have in my CSS container - I shouldn't have to manually type in each month, the program will have that variable somewhere.
