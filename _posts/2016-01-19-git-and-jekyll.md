Getting GitHub set up and playing with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and Markdown today. I was lucky enough to find [this walkthrough](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) that made it easy to get started.

I'm excited to keep tweaking this very simple site and practicing css and Git. So far, this feels much more comfortable than the website I set up last year with Wordpress - html and Markup seem legible to me, not so much with php.

I borrowed a laptop running Linux for my first foray as I got this site set up, but I'm looking forward to some new hardware in my life... stay tuned!
